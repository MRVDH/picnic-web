### FAQ
Frequently asked questions.

#### Why this when there is an app?
For when you don't have your phone with you but you'd still like to browse, manage your cart, etc.

#### I don't have a Picnic account.
You can see the products, but you'll need to login to manage your cart and account. Consider signing up and using my discount code [MAAR3267](https://picnic.app/nl/vriendenkorting/MAAR3267) so that we both get a 5 euro discount on our orders. ðŸ˜„

#### Something broke, what now?
Please report issues in the [Github issues section](https://github.com/MRVDH/picnic-web/issues) or email me at [info@maartenvandenhoven.com](mailto:info@maartenvandenhoven.com).

#### How do I run a local instance?
Clone or download the repo, run `npm install` in both the main directory and the `./client` directory. Then open two terminals. In the first terminal open the main directory and run `node app.js`, and in the other terminal open the `./client` directory and run `npm run serve`.
